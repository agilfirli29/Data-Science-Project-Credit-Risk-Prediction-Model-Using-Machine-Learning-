## 📌 Project Overview

This project is the final assignment for the **Data Scientist program at ID/X Partners**. The main objective is to build a predictive model to improve the accuracy of credit risk assessment in a multifinance company. By leveraging data analysis, the company can optimize business decisions when providing loans.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains historical credit records provided by ID/X Partners. It includes demographic, financial, and payment history information of customers.

## 🔎 Methodology

The project workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Understanding** — Initial exploration of the dataset to assess structure and quality.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — Univariate and bivariate analysis to identify patterns and correlations.
3. **Data Preparation** — Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling/normalization.
4. **Feature Engineering** — Creating additional features to enhance model performance.
5. **Modeling & Evaluation** — Building and evaluating Machine Learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* Pandas, Numpy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost

## 📊 Results

* A predictive credit risk model was developed to help the multifinance company identify high-risk applicants.
* EDA revealed that features such as payment history and income significantly impact credit status.
* The best-performing model was achieved using **XGBoost**, outperforming the baseline with higher evaluation metrics.

## 🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates that data-driven approaches can significantly improve the effectiveness of credit risk assessment. With the right model, companies can reduce default risks while maintaining sustainable business growth.
